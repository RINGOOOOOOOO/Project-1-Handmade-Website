      <p>I, like a fish, freely roam in the vast ocean.</p>

      <p>
        Only to realize, I am also a little fish confined in a massive fish
        tank.
      </p>

      <p>
        No matter how hard I struggle, I cannot swim beyond this transparent
        boundary.
      </p>

      <p>I see a fish, a fish emitting a green glow, floating in the air.</p>

      <p>She sways her tail, still wearing a smile.</p>

      <p>Her smile suddenly fills me with sadness.</p>

      <p>I cannot possess this fish.</p>

      <p>Faithful as a dog, tender as a cat,</p>

      <p>deeply loving like a cherished soulmate.</p>

      <p>
        Passing by an old bridge, memories of a song from my youth come to mind.
      </p>

      <p>Unconsciously, I softly hum it in the car.</p>

      <p>I escort a fish home.</p>

      <p>Back to the true home.</p>

      <p>She waves her tail, sliding into the vast blue ocean.</p>

      <p>This time, I really fall asleep.</p>

      <p>
